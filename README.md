📈 E-commerce Data Analysis and Market Segmentation
This project performs extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large, multinational retail transactional dataset to identify key sales trends, best-selling products, and top revenue-generating international markets.

✨ Key Features & Analysis
The analysis is executed in Python and focuses on deriving critical business intelligence:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles a large dataset (initial shape: 541,909 rows) by cleaning missing customer IDs, filtering non-positive quantities, and engineering a TotalPrice feature.

Domestic Market Analysis (United Kingdom):

Identifies the top 5 best-selling products by quantity sold.

The top product identified is PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE (80,995 units).

International Market Analysis:

Calculates and ranks the top 5 international markets based on Total Revenue.

The highest-performing markets are the Netherlands (Total Revenue: 285,446.34), EIRE, and Germany.

Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to generate clear bar charts, illustrating product popularity.

💻 Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential libraries for robust data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

Matplotlib: Used for generating visualizations of analysis results.

🚀 Getting Started
To run this analysis locally, you will need a copy of the raw data.csv file (the source data used in the notebook) and the required Python libraries.

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Execute the notebook (Big_data_Assignment.ipynb) to reproduce the cleaned dataset (cleaned_data.csv) and the final analysis files.
